# Some experiments with parameters estimation
Standart *odeint* solver was used. Solves 1,2 ODE equations with initial parameters. 
ParametersEstimation contains equation for Glucose/Insulin functions in human body. 

Estimation was performed using _optimize.minimize_ lib from skipy.
As criterion standart deviation was used.
